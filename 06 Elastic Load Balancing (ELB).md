# Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

* It distributes requests/traffic
* It's as per Region
* Integrates with Auto Scaling, Route 53
* Three types:
  * Classic (points to instances)
  * Application (points to Target Group by rules)
  * Network (the same as Application, but static IP address can be used and spread across instances - good for long connections)
